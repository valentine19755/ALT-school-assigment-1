          <h4>My Goals</h4>
           <p>As a college student at Bowen University, I've always been fascinated by the world of tech. Although I'm studying software engineering, I felt that my university education wasn't enough to give me a clear direction in the tech industry.

            Before joining Alt School, I was unsure about my career path. I had options like web development, backend development, and more, but I couldn't decide which one to pursue. Moreover, I struggled with remembering code and often found myself forgetting key steps.
            
            That's when a friend introduced me to Alt School Africa. I was impressed by their approach to nurturing students from scratch, regardless of their prior knowledge or experience. This sparked my interest in joining the program.

            Currently, I'm learning Python in my free time and have chosen cloud engineering as my specialization at Alt School. I'm excited about my decision and feel content with the direction I'm heading. My primary goal and the reason i chose Cloud enginerring
            icludes mastering programming fundamentals, and becoming a skilled clould engineer.
